// Most programming languages have an array data type that's separate from the language's other data types. JavaScript is unusual here: in JavaScript, arrays are a special type of object. We can see this by looking at typeof someArray, which will return 'object', just like it does for regular objects.

typeof {};
Result: 
'object'
