// Sometimes we want to turn an array of strings into a single string. We can join them together.


['a', 'b', 'c'].join('');
Result: 
'abc' 



['Amir', 'Betty'].join('');
Result: 
'AmirBetty' 

If we omit join's argument, the strings are joined with ',' by default.

> 
['Amir', 'Betty'].join();
Result: 
'Amir,Betty'
