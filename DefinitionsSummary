// There are more array methods, this is just a few of them. Also, there are tons of other actions that can be performed on arrays, try checking MDN docs herefor deeper insights.

Summary
toString() converts an array to a string separated by a comma.
join() combines all array elements into a string.
concat combines two arrays together or add more items to an array and then return a new array.
push() adds item(s) to the end of an array and changes the original array.
pop() removes the last item of an array and returns it
shift() removes the first item of an array and returns it
unshift() adds an item(s) to the beginning of an array and changes the original array.
splice() changes an array, by adding, removing and inserting elements.
slice() copies a given part of an array and returns that copied part as a new array. It does not change the original array.
split() divides a string into substrings and returns them as an array.
indexOf() looks for an item in an array and returns the index where it was found else it returns -1
lastIndexOf() looks for an item from right to left and returns the last index where the item was found.
filter() creates a new array if the items of an array pass a certain condition.
map() creates a new array by manipulating the values in an array.
reduce() calculates a single value based on an array.
forEach() iterates through an array, it applies a function on all items in an array
every() checks if all items in an array pass the specified condition and return true if passed, else false.
some() checks if an item (one or more) in an array pass the specified condition and return true if passed, else false.
includes() checks if an array contains a certain item.
Letâ€™s wrap it here; Arrays are powerful and using methods to manipulate them creates the Algorithms real-world applications use.
