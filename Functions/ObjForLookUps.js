Using Objects for Lookups
Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2]; // "Y"
alpha[24]; // "C"

var value = 2;
alpha[value]; // "Y"
// Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.


function phoneticLookup(val) {
    var result = "";
    var lookup = {
      "alpha": "Adams",
      "bravo": "Boston",
      "charlie": "Chicago",
      "delta": "Denver",
      "echo": "Easy",
      "foxtrot": "Frank"
    };
  // After converting our case statements into object properties you can make use of the variable `result` to let the function return the correct value.
  
  
    result = lookup[val];
    // Only change code above this line
    return result;
  }
